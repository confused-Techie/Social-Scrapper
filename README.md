Simple way to Scape Images from Social Media

This is an exteremly basic extension for Google Chrome whose purpose is to help you archive your data on Instagram.

Simply install the extension then navigate to your Instagram page and start browsing.

* After navigating to your Instagram page I would recommend Hitting "Control" + "F5" to reload the page and clear the cache. This ensures that all content is loaded remotely which is required for this extension to find it.

* Once you find a post with images you would like to archive click it opening the fullscreen post and navigate through the photos of the post if there are more than two.

* If you have a lot of posts to go through watch the counter on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar. I haven't determined the exact limit of how high its able to count, but I would recommend to stop navigating after 100 images, save them, refresh the page like before and start again where you left off.

The matching method for a valid full quality image isn't perfect and fails in some notable cases currently. 

* It may accidentally grab low res thumbnails for reels and stories. 

* While I've made changes to find the old storage scheme photos it may miss photos that were posted some time ago on the platform. 

* Keep in mind this is currently unable to grab any reels, videos, or stories. 

* If you have any issues feel free to open an issue here, and if needed try to link any relavent details like HAR logs of your browsing. But of course this can be submitted via email for privacy.
